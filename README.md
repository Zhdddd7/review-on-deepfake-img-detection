# A review-on-deepfake-img-detection
This repo is for a review and discussion of deepfake image detection methods.
## A list of relevant benchmarks or datasets in this topic:
1. FaceForensics++: Learning to Detect Manipulated Facial Images: FaceForensics++ is a forensics dataset consisting of 1000 original video sequences that have been manipulated with four automated face manipulation methods: Deepfakes, Face2Face, FaceSwap and NeuralTextures. [repo](https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics)
2. Parents and Children: Distinguishing Multimodal DeepFakes from Natural Images: The author devised a multimodal setting wherein fake images are synthesized by different textual captions, which are used as seeds for a generator. Under
their experiments, they proposed a new dataset called COCOFake. [repo](https://github.com/aimagelab/COCOFake)
## A list of relevant methods repos in this topic:
1. Faster Than Lies: Real-time Deepfake Detection using Binary Neural Networks:
The author introduces a novel deepfake detection approach on images using Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) for fast inference with minimal accuracy loss.
[repo](https://github.com/fedeloper/binary_deepfake_detection)
2. ADD: Frequency Attention and Multi-View based Knowledge Distillation to Detect Low-Quality Compressed Deepfake Images:
In this work, The author applys frequency domain learning and optimal transport theory in knowledge distillation (KD) to specifically improve the detection of low-quality compressed deepfake images.

3. Cross-Forgery Analysis of Vision Transformers and CNNs for Deepfake Image Detection:
The author compared a Vision Transformer with an EfficientNetV2 on a cross-forgery context based on the ForgeryNet dataset.

4. Taming Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis: The author demonstrated how combining the effectiveness of the induc
tive bias of CNNs with the expressivity of transformers enabled them to model and thereby synthesize high-resolution images. 
[repo](https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers)
5. Towards Solving the DeepFake Problem : An Analysis on Improving DeepFake Detection using Dynamic Face Augmentation: The author dynamically cuts out regions of an image using the face landmark information, which helps the model selectively attend to only the relevant regions of the input.
